# 🔐 CSE-478: Introduction to Computer Security Lab  
## 🧩 Lab 2 — Attacking Classic Crypto Systems (Group A)

### 🎯 **Objective**
The goal of this lab is to **attack and break classic cryptographic systems** (Caesar Cipher and Substitution Cipher).  
By doing so, we demonstrate the **weaknesses of traditional encryption methods** and learn how cryptanalysis techniques exploit them.

---

## 🧠 **Lab Overview**
In this lab, we will:
- Write programs to **decrypt ciphers** without knowing the key.
- Apply **brute-force search** for Caesar Cipher.
- Use **frequency analysis** for Substitution Cipher.
- Analyze which cipher was easier to break and explain why.

## ⚙️ **Tasks and Checkpoints**

### ✅ **Checkpoint 1 — Caesar Cipher Attack** (Marks: 5)

**Cipher Text:**
odroboewscdrolocdcwkbdmyxdbkmdzvkdpybwyeddrobo

#### 🧩 **Task:**
Write a program to break this cipher.  
Hint: The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher where each letter is replaced by one a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

🧾 Expected Output:

The correct shift will reveal an English message.
Show this result to your instructor for verification.

✅ Checkpoint 2 — Substitution Cipher Attack (Marks: 8 + 7)

Cipher 1:
af p xpkcaqvnpk pfg, af ipqe qpri, gauuikifc tpw, ceiri udvk tiki afgarxifrphni cd eao--wvmd popkwn, ...

Cipher 2:
aceah toz puvg vcdl omj puvg yudqecov, omj loj auum klu thmjuv hs klu zlcvu shv zcbkg guovz, ...

🧩 Task:

Write a program to break each cipher using frequency analysis.

Determine which cipher was easier to decrypt and explain why.

🧩 Expected Outcome

You will demonstrate the ability to decrypt Caesar and Substitution ciphers using custom scripts.

You will understand why substitution ciphers are weak against frequency analysis.

You will document your approach, reasoning, and results.
